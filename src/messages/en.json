    "description": "I am a software developer passionate about creating digital solutions that generate real impact. I have several years of experience building web and mobile applications, including Web3 projects and traditional systems. My journey includes volunteer work, technical leadership, and turning ideas into real products. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Flutter, Dart, and AWS Serverless architecture. I am a self-taught, dedicated, and persistent full stack developer with strong attention to detail and a focus on quality, performance, and accessibility. I believe that even the smallest adjustments make a difference in the final result. Outside of coding, I enjoy games, anime, traveling, hiking, nature, and graffiti. I am always looking for new challenges and professional growth.",
